## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Users must manually create branches (could be automated later).
- No validations yet for incorrect Git commands.
- README assumes basic Git knowledge — may be hard for absolute beginners.

> These are minor and expected in an early-stage learning project. Contributions to improve them are welcome.
## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Automate setup with a shell script (`setup.sh`)
- Add screenshots or screen recordings of the workflow
- Include a sample `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`
- Make README beginner-friendly with links to Git docs


> These improvements aim to make the project easier to use and more educational for others.
